Your Neighborhood Scientist is a nonprofit organization working to make science
accessible, understandable, and human-centered. We provide evidence-based
content that empowers people to engage with science confidently and critically.
By improving public understanding of science and building trust in scientists,
we help combat misinformation and promote lifelong science literacy.

Our work centers on transparency, equity, and curiosity. Through it, we aim to
break down barriers between scientists and the public—because we believe science
belongs to everyone. At YNS, we envision a society where scientists are seen not
as distant experts, but as engaged members of the community—trusted, respected,
and valued for their contributions to public life.

Our hope is that our readers will help us shift the current national narrative
by talking to their neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends about why science
is important in their communities and why we need science policy that supports
scientists doing the work they do best.

With your help, we can show the world that science benefits everyone and that
our communities are better off for it.
