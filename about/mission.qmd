## Mission

To improve public understanding of science by providing accessible, evidence-based information to combat misinformation and promote science literacy. We also work to improve public perception of scientists by fostering transparency, relatability, and trust between scientists and the communities they serve.

## Vision

A world where science and scientists are approachable, celebrated, and accessible—enabling all people, regardless of background or education, to engage confidently with the scientific information that shapes our lives and futures. We envision a society where scientists are seen not as distant experts, but as engaged members of the community—trusted, respected, and valued for their contributions to public life.

## Values

Clarity: We communicate science in ways that are understandable without sacrificing accuracy.

Equity: We believe access to scientific knowledge is a right, not a privilege.

Integrity: We ground our content in evidence, transparency, and ethical communication.

Curiosity: We celebrate questions, invite dialogue, and foster a love for science inquiry.

Community: We center the needs and voices of diverse audiences, building trust through engagement and respect.

Connection: We humanize scientists and science itself by creating spaces for meaningful interaction and understanding between scientists and the public.
