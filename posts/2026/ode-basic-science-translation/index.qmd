As a scientist, people often ask me how my research will benefit the public and
when it might be turned into a treatment. This question comes up both when
talking to my friends and family, and when applying for research grants. But
most of my research is basic science so the answer is not simple. My research
looks at how neurons in our brains process sounds. This is the first step to
understanding a fundamental biological mechanism. The foundational knowledge can
then take decades to build upon to reach patient care.

Medical research falls into three types: basic, translational and clinical.
Basic science is usually done in labs. It generates new elemental knowledge to
help us understand the foundational biology of how living systems work.
Translational science bridges basic science and clinical applications. It often
combines lab research with preclinical or early human studies. Clinical science
takes place in patient care settings. It directly studies safety and efficacy of
treatments for human diseases.

The timeline of progression from basic research to the clinic is difficult to
pin down. The translation stage is often said to take 17 years, but the timeline
of basic research and the jump from basic to translational is harder to count.
Even the starting point of basic research is unclear. Does it begin when a new
technique is developed? When a new cell type is discovered? When the function of
that new cell type is discovered? When the changes in function of that cell type
are revealed? Or only when a drug is first used to improve disease in an animal
model? Each step takes years, the whole process may take decades, and the exact
relevance to a disease is not always obvious at the start.

This example shows how science is not a simple straight path from basic to
clinical. Instead, it is a series of building blocks, with each block getting us
one step closer to treatments.

There also exists the feeling that science didn't use to be this way, and that
it has grown overcomplicated. Yet, this seems to exist due to a collective
cultural amnesia for the timeline of scientific progress. How we are taught in
school and how discoveries are reported in the media contribute to this by
simplifying the scientific process.

One example of this is the story of the discovery of penicillin. People often
remember the story of the discovery by Fleming in 1928 and quickly becoming
widely available for World War 2.  This simplified version of the story
overlooks the research foundation that led to this discovery. In **1871** Sir
John Scott Burdon-Sanderson showed that mold stopped bacteria from growing. In
**1874** Joseph Lister found that urine contaminated with mold did not have
bacteria growth. Then in **1875** John Tyndall showed that the _Penicillium_
fungus inhibited bacterial growth by causing bacteria to burst. Most strikingly,
in **1897** Ernest Duchesne showed that the _Penicillium glaucum_ fungus could
cure typhoid in guinea pigs. He thought that fungal and bacterial microbes may
be fighting for survival. Then was the memorable discovery: in **1928**
Alexander Fleming found that _Penicillium notatum_ stopped bacteria growing in a
petri dish. He thought that the fungus must be secreting a substance to kill the
bacteria and named the substance "penicillin". Fleming published his work, but
he could not purify or stabilize penicillin. Effectively no progress was made
for over a decade. In **1941** Howard Florey and Ernst Chain at Oxford
successfully extracted and purified penicillin. They then went on to prove its
potential as a life-saving antibiotic in mouse and human trials.

This example shows that science has always relied on previous building blocks.
While this makes a less attractive story, it also shows that perhaps our modern
scientific systems are more efficient. I'd like to hope that research like that
of Ernest Duchesne would be less likely to slip through the cracks in the modern
day.

It is also tempting to look back on science with the view that it should be easy
to predict future uses. However, some of the best historical scientists prove
this wrong. The physicist Heinrich Hertz discovered the existence of radio waves
but had a dismissive view of their practical use. He built equipment to generate
and detect radio waves and showed that they travel through space and reflect off
objects. He dismissed this discovery as a simple scientific demonstration with
no practical use. I guess we can't blame him for not predicting we'd be using
his invention to Bluetooth our music to our ears every day.

Often the greatest discoveries are deemed unimportant at the time of discovery.
That we can never be sure of what will be scientifically important in the future
means that we should support all science. Any medical research that builds solid
blocks between our foundation and treatments is a step in the right direction.
This holds true even if the subsequent steps are unclear given our current
limited knowledge of the future. The question to ask of current science may not
be "when will this produce a treatment?" but rather, "what future research could
this stimulate?". That shift in thinking might lead us to more creative and
impactful science.
