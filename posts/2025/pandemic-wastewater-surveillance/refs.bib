  abstract = {The highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 virus~clade 2.3.4.4b has caused the death of millions of domestic birds and thousands of wild birds in the USA since January 2022 (refs. 1--4). Throughout this outbreak, spillovers to mammals have been frequently documented5--12. Here we report spillover of the HPAI H5N1 virus to dairy cattle across several states in the USA. The affected cows displayed clinical signs encompassing decreased feed intake, altered faecal consistency, respiratory distress and decreased milk production with abnormal milk. Infectious virus and viral RNA were consistently detected in milk from affected cows. Viral distribution in tissues via immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization revealed a distinct tropism of the virus for the epithelial cells lining the alveoli of the mammary gland in cows. Whole viral genome sequences recovered from dairy cows, birds, domestic cats and a raccoon from affected farms indicated multidirectional interspecies transmissions. Epidemiological and genomic data revealed efficient cow-to-cow transmission after apparently healthy cows from an affected farm were transported to a premise in a different state. These results demonstrate the transmission of the HPAI H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b virus at a non-traditional interface, underscoring the ability of the virus to cross species barriers.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT                                           Since the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) H5N1 of clade 2.3.4.4b as a novel reassortant virus from subtype H5N8, the virus has led to a massive number of outbreaks worldwide in wild and domestic birds. Compared to the parental HPAIV H5N8 clade 2.3.4.4b, the novel reassortant HPAIV H5N1 displayed an increased ability to escape species barriers and infect multiple mammalian species, including humans. The virus host range has been recently expanded to include ruminants, particularly dairy cattle in the United States, where cattle-to-cattle transmission was reported. As with the avian 2.3.4.4.b H5N1 viruses, the cattle-infecting virus was found to transmit from cattle to other contact animals including cats, raccoons, rodents, opossums, and poultry. Although replication of the virus in cows appears to be mainly confined to the mammary tissue, with high levels of viral loads detected in milk, infected cats and poultry showed severe respiratory disease, neurologic signs, and eventually died. Furthermore, several human infections with HPAIV H5N1 have also been reported in dairy farm workers and were attributed to exposures to infected dairy cattle. This is believed to represent the first mammalian-to-human transmission report of the HPAIV H5N1. Fortunately, infection in humans and cows, as opposed to other animals, appears to be mild in most cases. Nevertheless, the H5N1 bovine outbreak represents the largest outbreak of the H5N1 in a domestic mammal close to humans, increasing the risk that this already mammalian adapted H5N1 further adapts to human-to-human transmission and starts a pandemic. Herein, we discuss the epidemiology, evolution, pathogenesis, and potential impact of the recently identified HPAIV H5N1 clade 2.3.4.4b in dairy cattle in the United States. Eventually, interdisciplinary cooperation under a One Health framework is required to be able to control this ongoing HPAIV H5N1 outbreak to stop it before further expansion of its host range and geographical distribution.},
