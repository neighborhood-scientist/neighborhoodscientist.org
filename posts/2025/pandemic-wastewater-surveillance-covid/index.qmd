When you grow up with parents working in specialized fields, you usually take
one of two paths: veer off in a totally different direction or follow in their
footsteps. I fall into the second category. My mom started working toward her
PhD when I was three years old, and that's when I fell in love with science.

By the time I was five, she was taking me into the lab for a few hours each week
when her experiments ran long. While she worked, I sat in the corner of the lab,
entertained by conducting small chores. Even the smallest glove size was too
large for my five-year-old hands, but I wore them and happily filled pipette tip
boxes making fun new patterns.  When I was ten, she defended her thesis. My dad
and I got her a card that read, "We don't know what you did, but we know it was
impressive!" Now, as a PhD student myself, I do know what she did, and just how
impressive it really was.

Her dedication to science and research shaped my childhood, and the lab she
worked in was a welcoming, inspiring place. The grad students read books with me
when my mother was busy conducting experiments, and I considered them to be
family. They all seemed so wise and shared the same passion for science that
really shaped my childhood. By high school, I knew I wanted to pursue research
at a high level and eventually earn a PhD. I applied to, and was accepted by,
the same university where she earned hers. Before I even registered for classes,
I started working as an undergraduate researcher in the very lab where she'd
done her thesis work. Her former advisor was thrilled to have me there,
continuing the family legacy.

At that point, I wasn't sure exactly what kind of research I wanted to do. Like
many early science students, I had big dreams: curing cancer with
virus-delivered drugs or discovering a new super-antibiotic to wipe out all
harmful bacteria. But in that lab, I found a different calling.

The lab focused on water quality microbiology. We were trying to figure out what
was increasing bacterial levels in recreational water bodies, like beaches,
rivers, and lakes. It felt like we were poop detectives. Was it a deer with a
stomach ache? A leaky sewage pipe? We'd investigate by heading to the scene
(wherever local agencies directed us), collecting evidence (water samples),
analyzing them (using tests to identify genetic markers from animals or humans),
and reporting back our findings. I loved the intersection of microbiology,
environmental science, and public health.

Then the pandemic hit.

When cases of COVID-19 started increasing, scientists realized that they needed
a fast and inexpensive method to identify areas with large numbers of infected
individuals, and they turned to wastewater surveillance. As someone already
working with wastewater, I understood the untapped potential of the information
it held. When someone is infected with a microorganism, that organism often
shows up in their waste. Before 2020, wastewater surveillance was mainly used to
track poliovirus, an infectious disease that spreads through contaminated food,
water, or contact with an infected person. Most people don't get sick from
polio, but in serious cases, it can cause paralysis or even death. Even though
polio doesn't usually cause stomach symptoms, the virus appears in large amounts
in feces and can survive for long periods in wastewater. In fact, wastewater
surveillance for polio has been in use since 1988, helping detect outbreaks both
in countries where the virus was thought to be eradicated and where it's still
common.

The first scientists to track SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater were in the Netherlands.
They successfully estimated how many people were infected in a city, before
clinical case numbers started to rise. Though COVID-19 doesn't typically cause
gastrointestinal symptoms, high levels of SARS-CoV-2 were found in patients'
fecal samples. That breakthrough prompted governments around the world to fund
and expand wastewater surveillance programs [@medema_presence_2020-1].

Building on that success, scientists began looking even deeper. Today, we use
wastewater surveillance to monitor not just viruses like Influenza A, mpox, and
norovirus, but also fungi like Candida auris (which resists many antifungal
treatments), and even antibiotic resistance genes.

And we're not stopping there.

A newer approach, wastewater sequencing, goes beyond identifying whether a virus
is present. It looks at which version is present. For example, in January 2021,
there were two variants of SARS-CoV-2 circulating, alpha and beta, and it was
crucial to differentiate between them because beta was believed to be more
infectious. If alpha could infect two people, beta might infect three. That may
not seem like a huge difference, but it matters at the population level.
Sequencing can give public health officials early warnings about which variants
were spreading and helped shape decisions to slow the spread.

I found this combination of sequencing and surveillance fascinating, and it's
what led me to where I am now. I'm currently a second-year PhD student designing
a method to sequence different Influenza A sub-clades from wastewater. A
sub-clade is a group of influenza viruses that have similar genetic backgrounds,
and being able to sort a virus in this way can help track its circulation.
Influenza viruses are classified based on their genetic makeup, particularly a
segment called "H." You may have heard of H5N1 or bird flu in the news. This
specific subtype has been around since the late 1990s, but recently a new
sub-clade has emerged, one that can infect cows
[@american_veterinary_medical_association_avian_nodate;
@caserta_spillover_2024-1; @mostafa_avian_2024-1]. That's raising alarms about
whether it could jump to other mammals, like humans.

Right now, wastewater surveillance can detect if H5N1 is present. But what we
can't yet confirm is whether it's the more dangerous sub-clade circulating in
cows, or just one that's commonly circulating in birds. That's where my work
comes in. I hope to use wastewater sequencing to tell the difference. If we can
do that, we'll not only help prevent the spread of bird flu, but also reduce
unnecessary fear when people hear that H5N1 was detected in their local
wastewater. I am working on a protocol that will identify sources of fecal
matter in wastewater and the sub-clade of influenza A virus that is circulating.
This protocol can eventually be implemented across the country and potentially
globally to use in response to detections of H5N1 in wastewater.

To me, the role of a scientist is to expand the knowledge in my field in a way
that directly benefits my community. Research like my own has led to discoveries
that have saved millions of lives.  As I learned from my mother early on,
science is about understanding how the world works, and using that understanding
to create a better, safer, and more informed society.

severe cholera outbreak in 1854 where John Snow hypothesized that contaminated
water from a particular pump was the source of the outbreak, rather than the
popular theory that the infectious agent was transmitted by "miasma" or bad air.
Snow's work shaped the modern epidemiology field as we know it.
