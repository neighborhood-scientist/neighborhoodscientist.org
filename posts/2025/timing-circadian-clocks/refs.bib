  abstract = {Longitudinal studies associate shiftwork with cardiometabolic disorders but do not establish causation or elucidate mechanisms of disease. We developed a mouse model based on shiftwork schedules to study circadian misalignment in both sexes. Behavioral and transcriptional rhythmicity were preserved in female mice despite exposure to misalignment. Females were protected from the cardiometabolic impact of circadian misalignment on a high-fat diet seen in males. The liver transcriptome and proteome revealed discordant pathway perturbations between the sexes. Tissue-level changes were accompanied by gut microbiome dysbiosis only in male mice, biasing toward increased potential for diabetogenic branched chain amino acid production. Antibiotic ablation of the gut microbiota diminished the impact of misalignment. In the United Kingdom Biobank, females showed stronger circadian rhythmicity in activity and a lower incidence of metabolic syndrome than males among job-matched shiftworkers. Thus, we show that female mice are more resilient than males to chronic circadian misalignment and that these differences are conserved in humans.           ,              Female mice are more resilient to circadian misalignment than males, and this sexual dimorphism is conserved in human shift workers.           ,              Cardiometabolic sex differences in circadian stress                            Working night shifts increases risk of cardiometabolic dysfunction. Anderson               et~al               . report that among mice on a high-fat diet and an altered circadian schedule similar to that of shiftwork, females were more resilient to the cardiometabolic consequences of the regimen compared with male mice, which showed stress-related changes at both the tissue and microbiome levels. Sexual dimorphism in cardiometabolic dysfunction was replicated in a human cohort of shiftworkers and might in part explain why males are more prone to developing metabolic disease. ---Catherine A.~Charneski},

  abstract = {The physiology of a wide variety of organisms is organized according to periodic environmental changes imposed by the earth's rotation. This way, a large number of physiological processes present diurnal rhythms regulated by an internal timing system called the circadian clock. As part of the rhythmicity in physiology, drug efficacy and toxicity can vary with time. Studies over the past four decades present diurnal oscillations in drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. On the other hand, diurnal variations in the availability and sensitivity of drug targets have been correlated with time-dependent changes in drug effectiveness. In this review, we provide evidence supporting the regulation of drug kinetics and dynamics by the circadian clock. We also use the examples of hypertension and cancer to show current achievements and challenges in chronopharmacology.},

  abstract = {Attention is a cognitive process crucial for human performance. It has four components: tonic alertness, phasic alertness, selective attention, and sustained attention. All the components of attention show homeostatic (time awake, sleep deprivation) and circadian (time of day) variations. The time course of the circadian rhythms in attention is important to program work and school-related activities. The components of attention reach their lowest levels during nighttime and early hours in the morning, better levels occur around noon, and even higher levels can be observed during afternoon and evening hours. However, this time course can be modulated by chronotype, sleep deprivation, age, or drugs. Homeostatic and circadian variations have also been found in other basic cognitive processes (working memory and executive functions), with a time course similar to that observed for attention. Data reviewed in this paper suggests the need to consider circadian rhythms, age, and chronotype of the person, when programming schedules for work, study, school start time, school testing, psychological testing, and neuropsychological assessment.},
