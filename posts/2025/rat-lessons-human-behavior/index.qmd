As the bright white rat looked up at the camera and froze, I started my
stopwatch. His body halted all movement, frozen in time for 1, 2, 3,...9 seconds
before wandering to the other end of the chamber. I pause the stopwatch as soon
as his body lurches forward to end his trance. This ordinary Tuesday for me
makes my parents scratch their heads. How could any of this work help us better
understand post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)?

All humans, at some point, experience moments that really unsettle them.
Something that leaves them feeling cautious, more vigilant.  Some humans go on
to avoid certain places constantly, feel high levels of stress or guilt, or feel
intrusive fearful memories entering their minds by surprise. I research how the
brain stores memories of traumatic events, and why only some people experience a
fear response in places unrelated to the trauma. By creating fearful memories in
the domesticated Sprague Dawley rat, I can study this variation in humans to
better understand PTSD.

Because our goal is to understand the biology of human fear, rat fear must be
artificially created in my experiments. Animals enter a behavioral chamber,
where a 2-second footshock is delivered to create a fearful memory of that
location. My animal research is tightly regulated by the American Association
for Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care, my university's Unit for Laboratory
Animal Medicine, and the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. These
three groups must approve any and all experimental treatments using live
animals, for the simple fact that rats are living creatures who feel and think.
Any groups working with animals for research are constantly monitored, guided,
and counseled to ensure excess stress does not occur.

My fear experiments have three key days:
1) Receive Shock, 2) "Relaxing" Day, and 3) Return to Shock Location.
The electric shock on the first day teaches the rats this box is an unsafe
location. The next day, animals are placed in a chamber they have never seen
before, with new smells and visuals. The last day sees animals return to the
same boxes where they formed the fear memory. For reasons I am still
researching, a select group of rats freeze all body movement in the "Relaxing"
Day's chamber, but not when returning to the actual box they learned to be
afraid of. This generalization of the original fearful memory to a place that
they should not be afraid of is a behavior humans do as well. I can then look at
their brains to identify the biological reasons the fear memory was generalized.

I am well aware of the fact I am making another living creature experience
distress so I can help my own species. No computer model exists that perfectly
replicates how the brain stores memories, so animal research provides a way to
understand this important topic. All researchers are trained to openly discuss
ethical responsibility as experiments are designed. I altered my strategy to
ensure every step of the experiment includes respect for the animals' lives. I
tickle and gently groom every animal before my experiments begin. My heart
smiles when I see them run to the edge of the cage to play with me. I minimize
how much time the animals actually spend in my hands, so the majority of their
lives can be spent in their home-cage with unlimited food and water. I train -
and often scold - my students on proper handling techniques to prevent pain when
animals are moved. I shower with the same soaps and shampoo before entering the
behavioral room to eliminate the smell of my cat at home. Laboratory
veterinarians come check on all animals daily, and provide care the moment
something seems off. Suffering is an unpleasant feature of living. It will
always exist, though we always have the power to mitigate it.

To create memory, a collection of neurons in your brain link themselves together
in a large circuit. You can think of it like a series of train tracks,
connecting numerous hubs to one another. One of those hubs, the hippocampus, has
a subregion scientists call CA1. This part of the hippocampus sends tracks to
the amygdala, the brain's fear center. Current research suggests this CA1 path
to the amygdala is essential for storing memories of fearful locations. The
actual process of storing memories here seems to vary from human to human and in
rat to rat. This research will help us better understand what specific
biological process is happening in CA1 neurons, improving our ability to detect,
treat, and prevent the development of PTSD in humans.

The differences in how my rats behave after fear learning reveals a human truth:
individual variation exists in our responses to stress.

As a neuroscientist, it would be deeply foolish of me not to apply this lesson
to the wonderful students I interact with in the laboratory. One of my
undergraduate mentees wanted to apply to graduate school and had some difficulty
writing application essays. I noticed every time I would ask for a draft, her
movements would shift; brows flattened, shoulders shrunk inward, and a
trampoline magically appeared under their leg.

I asked her, "How does it feel when you sit down to write a draft?". I listened
to the earnest outpour of stressors overwhelming my student's mind, and the
gradual introduction of widened eyes, relaxed shoulders, and deepened breaths. I
understood that shift in behavior as her realization that I only sought to help
her. Together we created a writing-wellness plan: 1) must be seated in the
sunlight by water, 2) have a separate document to write frustrations and ideas,
and 3) NO ONE CAN CHEW FOOD NEARBY! She was extremely adamant about that last
one. She certainly loved to write, but felt that she froze up when writing about
personal experiences. Our plan acknowledged and anticipated this freeze
response; the next week she had gone from a rough paragraph and a few bullets to
a fully completed draft.

The nervous system that exists throughout our bodies serves to protect and guide
us. Even now as you read this, millions of tiny cells are calculating inputs
from other cells, allowing your eyes to move across the sentence, and for you to
understand their words, and for you to feel the sense of being you! When
traumatic experiences occur, each individual nervous system responds within a
measurable spectrum. My ongoing research seeks to understand why some of those
responses lead to PTSD. As I strive to understand these fear responses in my
animal model, my work has taught me how to add kindness to interactions with
other humans. All of us can generate fear responses, even when we are in a safe
place. Accepting that reality gives me the skill to anticipate freezing from
those around me, time it, and offer kindness to address whatever part of the
brain was crying out for help.
