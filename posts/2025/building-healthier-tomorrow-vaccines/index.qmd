Quiz time: What has been rigorously tested since 1796, extensively
peer-reviewed, and saved over
[154 million lives](https://www.who.int/news/item/24-04-2024-global-immunization-efforts-have-saved-at-least-154-million-lives-over-the-past-50-years)
in the past 50 years alone? And the answer is—vaccines! Vaccines have become a
hot topic recently, but what exactly are they, and why are they so important? As
a public health professional, these are some of the most common questions I
get—and I love answering them! It gives me the chance to share evidence-based
information so that people can make informed healthcare decisions for themselves
and their loved ones.

Imagine it's the 1870s. The Industrial Revolution is in full swing, bringing
exciting new technologies. Factories are rising, cities are growing, and people
are living closer together than ever before. But with inadequate sanitation,
poor working conditions, and no modern medicine, diseases spread rapidly. One of
the worst illnesses at the time? Smallpox.
[Smallpox was a highly contagious viral infection](https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/index.html),
often spreading through airborne particles from coughs and sneezes. If you were
unfortunate enough to catch it, you spend agonizing days with high fevers,
painful rashes, pustules, and sometimes even death. Smallpox killed about 3 of
every 10 people infected, and those who survived often experienced permanent
disability, blindness, and scarring on the face. In its final 100 years,
smallpox claimed an estimated 500 million lives. It was devastating—until
science changed everything. Enter Edward Jenner, the doctor who developed the
first [smallpox vaccine](https://www.cdc.gov/smallpox/about/history.html).
His breakthrough was so effective that, by 1980, the World Health Organization
declared smallpox [eradicated](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/su48a7.htm#:~:text=Eradication%3A%20Permanent%20reduction%20to%20zero,nature%20or%20in%20the%20laboratory.).
That means there are no more natural cases of smallpox anywhere in the world—a
direct result of global vaccination efforts. But here's the key: vaccines only
work if people take them. In the 19th and 20th centuries, millions of people saw
the need for vaccination and stepped up to protect themselves and their
communities. Their willingness to get vaccinated changed history. It was this
same community effort mindset that has helped
[eradicate, or get close to eradicating](https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases)
polio, diphtheria, pertussis, and several diseases that affect animals. When we
all work together for the greater good we can make real and lasting change.

We might not be living in the 1800s, but infectious diseases haven't
disappeared. Yes, we have better sanitation and advanced medicine, but we also
live in an era of overwhelming information—and misinformation. Some falsehoods
are spread unintentionally (misinformation), while others are deliberately
designed to deceive (disinformation). We also live in a time where internet
personalities' opinions on vaccination often weigh as heavily in public opinion
as facts provided by the scientific experts. That's where
[public health](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=what+is+public+health&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8)
comes in. Public health is about protecting and improving the health of people
and communities. Some professionals focus on nutrition, others on disease
tracking, and others—like me—on prevention. And the best tool we have for
preventing disease? Vaccines.

The [immune system](https://kidshealth.org/en/parents/immune.html#:~:text=How%20Does%20the%20Immune%20System,proteins%20lock%20onto%20specific%20antigens.)
 in your body is composed of various organs and is your body's
defense against infections. It is the major feature our bodies have to keep us
safe. When a virus or bacteria enters your body, your immune system identifies
it, attacks it, and remembers it for the future. Vaccines take advantage of this
by introducing a harmless version of a virus or bacteria,
[allowing your body to build immunity](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/basics/explaining-how-vaccines-work.html)
without you having to suffer through the actual disease. If you ever do
encounter the real germ, your immune system will recognize it and respond much
more efficiently, often preventing serious illness. But vaccines don't just
protect you. They help protect the community, especially those who are
immunocompromised—people with weakened immune systems who can't safely receive
vaccines or fight infections effectively. This includes infants, the elderly,
cancer patients, and people with autoimmune diseases, among others. When the
majority of a community is vaccinated, diseases struggle to spread, creating a
protective barrier known as herd immunity. This is how we protect our most
vulnerable neighbors.

<hr>

The Immunization Alliance of Michigan is still in its early stages. As the
leader of that vaccine coalition and nonprofit, I spend my days working on
ensuring we can operate as an organization and provide meaningful education and
services to traditionally under-served populations across Michigan. I do this by
engaging with community members to see what their needs are, answering
questions, and addressing concerns about vaccines. Many fears stem from
misinformation, so I work with healthcare providers to give them resources and
trainings on how to feel confident when talking about vaccines to their
patients, create media content in various formats and languages to give to
communities around the state, and I eventually hope to start working with the
state legislature to get better vaccine education and access laws passed to
improve health for everyone across the state. At its core, public health is
about helping people live longer, healthier lives. But for that to happen, they
need access to accurate, unbiased, and evidence-based information. Vaccine
hesitancy that stems from misinformation inherently means that people aren't
truly making informed choices—because they don't have all the facts! Right now,
working in vaccine advocacy is tough. Political divisiveness and funding cuts
make it feel like an uphill battle. It's frustrating to see vital resources at
risk when all we want is for people to be safe and healthy.

But despite the challenges, we keep showing up. We keep advocating. Because this
work matters. If even one person reads the scientific research and
recommendations we share and decides to get vaccinated to protect themselves or
their community, that's a win. Public health workers, including myself, will
continue fighting for you, your family, and your community. We all want
ourselves and our loved ones to be healthy. Getting vaccinated is one of the
most effective ways to achieve that. It is so important that we continue to work
together to prevent the spread of disease so that we can ensure a healthier
future for everyone!
