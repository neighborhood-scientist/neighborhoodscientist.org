Is scientific research valuable and worth funding if it doesn't directly impact
human health? This question has been vaulted to the forefront of American
discourse on science and its support by taxpayer money. I must be honest: as a
basic science researcher (we'll get to what this means in a minute), I'm
frustrated by the premise of this question. The answer is so obvious to me: a
resounding "YES!", and my reasoning is both philosophical and practical. I
_believe_ -- though I recognize and respect opposition to this belief -- that
there is intrinsic value in knowledge. However, I also _know_ that funding
research simply intended to understand more about the natural world has
profoundly shaped how we treat and cure disease. As I write this, I feel
responsible for acknowledging a personal blind spot while conveying an
overlooked and yet critically important sentiment: we, as scientists, have not
done a very good job of communicating the importance of our scientific
inquisition to you, the public. So, while I am frustrated by the ongoing
valuation of my intellectual passions and life's work as a scientist, I
recognize that you deserve to know why what I do is valuable, how it improves
your life, and why it's worthy of taxpayer support.

In this discussion, I want to drive home a very important point: throughout
history, scientific curiosity and inquisition -- even when not intended to
directly impact human health -- has created the foundation of knowledge needed
to make medical breakthroughs possible today. You might be surprised (and
fascinated) to find out that seemingly tangential discoveries made in organisms
such as worms, flies, and fungi have fundamentally improved our understanding of
human biology and what goes awry during disease. Importantly, at the time of
discovery, the value of this research was unknowable, but with time its
application has become invaluable. Therefore, funding basic science research
does not simply support our curiosity as scientists, but it is also an
indispensable long-term investment in your health. Let's discuss why.

Before we take a step back into history and showcase the impact of some seminal
basic science discoveries, let's first cover relevant terminology. In a very
general sense, scientific research can be broken down into two arms: basic
research and translational research. Basic science research is, at its very
core, driven by curiosity and intended to understand more about the natural
world. Its aim isn't to cure human disease per se, but rather to ask (and
answer) the question of how and why things are the way they are. I'm defining
this in a very general way to be inclusive of the many different domains of
scientific research, but some example questions that researchers may ask and
experimentally seek to answer are as follows: How do dietary nutrients impact
the way your immune cells function? How do the cells in your body divide and
what are the signals that cause them to do this? How does the brain integrate
and process sensory information so that your behavior aligns with physiological
and environmental needs? What makes plants sensitive or resistant to stress
imposed by the environment, whether that be from pathogens (i.e., microbes that
can infect and damage them) or extreme weather patterns?

You can imagine the endlessness of this line of questioning, which makes science
so exciting! However, perhaps you can also appreciate that while none of these
questions alone are posed to directly advance human health, application of the
discoveries resulting from them absolutely could and often do. This is where
translational science takes center stage. At its core, translational science is
the applied arm of research, leveraging our fundamental knowledge of how things
work -- again, discovered through basic experimentation -- to then design
studies that are directly intended to improve well-being and/or treat disease.
As an example, let's take the first scientific question posed above, which just
so happens to be the line of inquiry guiding my research:  How do dietary
nutrients impact the way your immune cells function?

To answer this question, I work with both human and mouse samples to
experimentally determine what metabolic fuels -- the carbohydrates, fats, and
amino acids acquired through the foods you eat -- are needed for your immune
cells to carry out their intended protective functions. When I design
experiments in the lab, I don't do so with any specific disease in mind. Rather,
I focus on the exploratory value of gaining knowledge, and I allow my curiosity
to conceptually advance the scientific conclusions supported by my data. I, as
we say, "follow the science" by simply allowing my empirical observations to
instruct the next steps in my experimentation. As a result of this approach, in
the three years of my postdoctoral fellowship research, my team has uncovered
many fascinating insights into the nutritional safeguards and vulnerabilities of
the immune system, and we are becoming well-positioned to begin translating
these findings into clinically meaningful contexts like infection and cancer
when your immune cells need to do their job in metabolically hostile
environments. Will the research I'm doing today save your life tomorrow?
Absolutely not, but it does have the potential to revolutionize how we might
nutritionally and therapeutically target immune cell metabolism to improve human
health in just a matter of years, which is why my work has been so generously
funded by organizations and agencies like the American Heart Association and
National Institutes of Health.

Thinking big picture, what I want to underscore here is that this relationship
between the basic and translational arms of science is necessarily synergistic.
Each arm informs and accelerates the other, and both must **coexist** for medical
breakthroughs to happen. It should come as no surprise then that the United
States' financial commitment to basic science research is the reason why we have
been a global powerhouse in the health sciences. In essence, your taxpayer
support is the lifeline that has created opportunities for scientists like me to
transform curiosity into the life-saving tools, technologies, and medicines that
in turn benefit you. But don't just take my word for it, let's turn to history
to show you how.

Most cancer therapies, regardless of their mechanisms of action, share the same
primary goal: to cause cancer cells to die. At face value, this seems rather
simple, right? The complexity arises from the way that a cancer cell dies, which
can come in many different flavors, each with its own set of biological
triggers, genetic requirements, and consequences for how surrounding cells
interpret and respond to it. These different "flavors" collectively comprise the
study of programmed cell death (also referred to as regulated cell death), and
many major advances in cancer therapy can be attributed to scientific
discoveries that have enhanced our ability to kill tumor cells by targeting an
exploitable and suitable regulated cell death modality. What may come as a
surprise to you, however, is that the study of programmed cell death originated
from basic science research performed using _Caenorhabditis elegans_ (_C. elegans_),
a small roundworm with simple anatomy that has long served as an experimental
tool to study how animals develop.

After Dr. Sydney Brenner's work in the 1960s established _C. elegans_ as a model
organism for developmental biology research, the work of two scientists, Drs.
John Sulston and H. Robert Horvitz (and others not mentioned here), determined
that programmed cell death is a naturally occurring biological process with
specific genetic requirements for roundworms to normally grow
[@sulston_post-embryonic_1977;@yuan_c_1993]. Yes, you read that right: during
embryogenesis, we need certain cells to die for our organs and tissues to
properly develop (otherwise, we'd all have webbed toes and fingers)! This Nobel
Prize-winning research set the stage for subsequent discovery of analogous genes
and pathways in humans, and it has profoundly shaped our understanding of how
and why programmed cell death is both developmentally important and
therapeutically exploitable to kill unwanted cells. Let's zoom out for a second.
How remarkable is it that scientific curiosity for the development of a
roundworm has so meaningfully advanced our understanding of human biology and
influenced how we treat our most challenging diseases? _This_ is the value of
basic science.

Research using fruit flies tells a similar tale. We all know that our immune
cells detect invading microbes and help to protect us against infectious
diseases. The cells comprising our innate immune system (i.e., the body's first
line of defense against pathogens) can do so in a remarkably rapid way. But how
do they achieve this? In the late 1980s, a prominent immunologist by the name of
Dr. Charles Janeway first theorized that our innate immune system must use
receptor molecules that readily detect specific molecular "patterns" intrinsic
to invading microbes (e.g., components of their cell wall), thereby making them
distinguishable from the patterns that make up our own body. It was an
intriguing hypothesis that would explain why our immune system is so good at
quickly discerning self (i.e., us) vs. non-self (i.e., pathogenic bugs), but it
lacked sound experimental evidence.

In a series of landmark discoveries made throughout the 1990s (including those
from one of Dr. Janeway's postdoctoral trainees, a distinguished immunologist,
Dr. Ruslan Medzhitov), scientists cleverly used genetic analyses of a known
human immune signaling molecule to uncover similar elements in other species.
The hope at the time was to uncover new genetic data that could help point
researchers toward the human gene(s) encoding Janeway's theorized
"pattern-recognition receptors". Shockingly, what they found in _Drosophila
melanogaster_, colloquially known as the fruit fly, was a gene named _Toll_,
which was both genetically similar to the already characterized immune signaling
molecule <u>and</u> other human genes previously unknown to researchers. These
novel genetic sequences -- again, brought to light by comparative genetics in
the fruit fly -- were subsequently termed Toll-like receptor genes and
experimentally demonstrated to encode the very pattern-recognition machinery
that Janeway hypothesized would exist throughout the human innate immune system
[@gay_drosophila_1991;@medzhitov_human_1997]. Let's zoom out again and take a
moment to appreciate how amazing this is: because of the herculean efforts made
by countless basic scientists to study and functionally characterize genes
comprising the fruit fly genome, the stage was set for researchers like Dr.
Janeway to uncover the biological basis of pathogen detection and protection
against infectious disease. Not only did this research fundamentally advance our
basic understanding of the human immune system, but it also fueled the
development of therapeutics that improve our ability to fight off pathogens and
cancers and dampen the immune response when inflammation goes awry. Here again,
_this_ is the value of basic science, and it's saving lives every single day.

To be candid, if I didn't have so many experiments to complete at this stage in
my career, I'd genuinely love to write a book highlighting more stories like
those showcased above -- the list is endless. Indeed, not captured here are the
many discoveries made using yeast genetics to understand more about how and when
our cells divide, or insights into how zebrafish have helped to better
characterize the genetic basis of many human diseases. Nevertheless, what I hope
you can take away from this essay is that curiosity-driven research has
profoundly changed our lives for the better, and it's simply a consequence of
researchers asking the questions, "How?" and "Why?" Research is our passion, and
we are indebted to society for supporting our life's work. Truly, we thank **you**.
In turn, I hope you can see the value in what we contribute to you and your
health, even when our research questions appear tangential or irrelevant.
Because understanding more about the natural world is not only what gives our
professional lives purpose and meaning, it is also the foundation of your
well-being and the fabric of what has made the United States a leader in
biomedical research. Basic science is the lifeblood of medical innovation, and
it needs your support now more than ever.

Does this sentiment resonate with you? If so, share your excitement and tell
someone what you learned about science today.
