Hello!

My name is Audrey, and I'm a neuroscientist. I study brain cells: how they talk
to each other, what they're saying, and how they help us figure out what's going
on in our environments.

I started this newsletter because I'm increasingly concerned about how science
and medical research is viewed by the public. There's been a shift over the last
few years in how I hear people talk about science, and it's at odds with what I
see and experience in my day-to-day life as a researcher. I feel so excited
about the amount of progress being made in the scientific community, from
treatments for HIV and pediatric cancers to new vaccines for RSV and cancer, but
I sense a growing unease with these same discoveries amongst the general public,
with an increase in discussion of conspiracy theories (like the myth that
vaccines cause autism), a decrease in the number of people who support public
health measures backed by science (like fluoride in our drinking water), and
general growing distrust in the scientific and medical communities.

I'm sure there are many factors at play that have widened this chasm between
scientists and non-scientists, but I think one is a misunderstanding of how
science works: how basic science informs medical breakthroughs, how science is
funded in the US, and the role that pharmaceutical companies and medical
professionals play. I think most people would be surprised to hear that much of
what we know about human genetics comes from studying yeast and worms, or that
the US federal government funds upwards of 90% of the research happening at
universities across the US, both public and private.

In addition, I think another big driver of this gap between scientists and the
general public is a misunderstanding of who scientists are. I've worked in
academia for the last nine years of my life, and the people I work with are some
of the most compassionate, hard-working, dedicated individuals, who sacrifice
many years of their lives to bring new advancements into the world that will
make our lives better. As I read Facebook comments and see the rhetoric on TV, I
often find myself wishing I could just show people the scientists I know: I wish
I could bring you to lab and show you the people I work with every day, show you
how hard they are working, and show you how the work they do makes your life
better and our communities stronger.

Your Neighborhood Scientist is my initiative to do just that: to tell the world
how the scientists in your neighborhoods are working hard—just like you—to leave
a positive mark on this world. I started this newsletter because I believe that
we can work together to show the world that science is critical to the health
and well-being of our communities. Changing this rhetoric is no small task, and
I think it starts with information: how does this all work? How does the work
scientists do every day, funded by taxpayers, eventually end up handed to you
over the counter at your local pharmacy in a paper bag that contains life-saving
medication? How does it strengthen our economy? How does it enhance our national
defense and emergency preparedness?

I also realize that if you're reading this newsletter, you're likely someone who
is somewhat interested in science. I probably don't have to convince you too
much that we should fund basic science research, and that scientists are
incredible, genuine people who are trying to make the world a better place. But
why do you think that? Maybe it's because you understand the intricacies of
science, and you know about NIH institutes and CAR-T cell pathways. Or maybe
not: most likely, you believe in science because you know and trust me, Audrey,
your neighborhood scientist. People's beliefs are not informed by facts and
information: they are informed by feelings and trust.

In our newsletter, we'll work to fill the science information gap by stressing
the importance of basic science research and providing information about how it
works, and I hope that you do learn more about the work scientists do. But to
me, it's not important if you remember specific details, like what an indirect
rate is at the NIH. What's important is that you feel inspired to tell other
people that know and trust you about how important you think science is. Perhaps
over time they might even become convinced that they, too, should advocate for
scientists and good science policy. The goal is to provide the knowledge that
scientists are working hard to make the world a better place and use this as a
vehicle to spread positive feelings and trust surrounding science,  because
these are the things that change people's minds.

I don't know what will ultimately happen with this journey, but if you read all
the way through: thank you. Tell someone who trusts you about science today, and
see you in a couple weeks.
