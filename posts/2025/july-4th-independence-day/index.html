<p>Here at Your Neighborhood Scientist, we’re excited to highlight American patriotism in a way you might not always think about: scientific research. If you’re an American taxpayer, your tax dollars currently go towards the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the world’s largest funder of biomedical research. As a result, the US is the primary driver of science and technology innovation in the world. Between 2010 and 2019, 354 out of 356 of drugs approved by the FDA received funding from the NIH during their <a href="https://www.bentley.edu/news/new-study-shows-nih-investment-new-drug-approvals-comparable-investment-pharmaceutical">development</a> – a whopping 99.4%. These medications included Keytruda, a breakthrough cancer treatment, Trikafta, a life-changing therapy for many with cystic fibrosis, and Imbruvica, a breakthrough therapy for blood cancers. As your neighborhood scientists, we want you to feel proud to be American this July 4th because those breakthroughs came from your tax dollars – and as scientists, we’re proud to be entrusted with those dollars to generate tomorrow’s medical breakthroughs.</p>
<p>We recently asked some of our neighborhood scientists why they are proud to do taxpayer-funded scientific research in the US. In their answers, we hope that you, too, can feel some American pride in science this July 4th. Here are a few:</p>

<p>“As a US scientist, I get to make discoveries about how nature works with creative, intelligent, hard-working people from all around the world. US taxpayer-funded research grants and fellowships are pushing science forward from a knowledge perspective, and also by training the next generation of scientists and shifting the culture of academia to welcome people from all walks of life, helping the world to benefit from their unique contributions. I’m proud to make basic science discoveries that can one day inform medical breakthroughs (like the scientists who contribute to mRNA vaccines, and treatments for chronic illnesses and genetic conditions).”</p>

Research has the potential to change this, and I am proud to be among those working to change the status quo. When people receive the diagnosis for a condition such as Alzheimer’s, it can be devastating, both to them and to their loved ones. Still, many people are comforted and even reassured by the fact that we are working on a solution… even if we do not have one today, there is hope for tomorrow.

<p>Over the next week, we’ll continue to highlight the incredible scientists that do this government-funded research and the citizens who benefit and support it, from high school teachers to those obtaining medical treatment through NIH-funded clinical trials.

We hope that you’ll share with your neighbors why funding science is patriotic, and we hope you feel proud, too. Because those scientific breakthroughs? They’re made in the USA – thanks to you.</p>

<p>Science and research innovations are everywhere – if you just know where to look! Almost everything you see in the natural environment, we know more about because of scientific research. Why do the leaves fall from the trees in the fall? Why do birds fly south? What makes the tides go in and out every day?</p>
<p>This knowledge is important because it helps us plan for things like hurricanes and figure out how to set up home foundations so they don’t sink into the ground. It also helps us develop innovations that help us preserve the natural world – like window stickers to avoid migrating bird collisions.</p>
<p>Today, we’re highlighting scientists who love the taxpayer-funded work they do because it helps them understand the world around us. How has science helped you understand the world around you?</p>

<p>When you think of creativity, you probably think of artists and writers. But what about scientists? For many, scientific research provides an opportunity to ask creative questions and generate new ways to answer them. In doing so, scientists are able to tackle today’s problems from unique angles and provide solutions that haven’t been used before. Ultimately, this can generate novel disease cures and treatment options for people that didn’t previously exist.</p>
<p>Today, we’re highlighting scientists who love the creative freedom offered by basic science research funded by the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation – the two largest funders of science research. We are inspired by their commitment to finding creative solutions to tough problems, and we hope you are, too.</p>

<p>The two largest funders of research in the U.S. – the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation – are funded by taxpayer dollars. This research is behind every medical breakthrough we see today, from the drugs on the market to new imaging methods to detect cancers to robotics that make surgery less invasive.</p>
<p>That also means that these breakthroughs are all because of <em>you</em>. If you pay taxes in the U.S., every cancer cure and Alzheimer’s drug and addiction treatment option is all thanks to you and the funding from your tax dollars for the NIH and NSF. And here at Your Neighborhood Scientist, we think that’s something to be proud of.</p>

<p>We asked scientists across the U.S. why they’re proud to do science here, and their answers ranged from curing diseases to giving back to understanding the world around us. Many also mentioned that they love to do science here because it’s <em>hard</em>. U.S. science is held to an extremely high standard of excellence – grant funding is competitive, publishing requires multiple reviews from peers, and studies have to be designed rigorously. That high standard drives scientists to do excellent work with the critical eye that is needed to develop cures for today’s most complex diseases, from cancer and autoimmune disorders to genetic conditions and dementia.</p>

<p>If you or a loved one has ever received a challenging medical diagnosis, you know that navigating a diagnosis like cancer or a genetic condition can be daunting. When we asked U.S. scientists why they love the science they do, many shared that their work is able to be a source of hope for those who have been diagnosed with challenging medical conditions. Each day, new treatment options become available that turn previously devastating diagnoses into a hiccup in life. Scientists love the work they do because they can provide hope – because they know that their work can increase the quality of life and can even save the lives of those impacted by the diseases they study.</p>
