Here at Your Neighborhood Scientist, we're excited to highlight American
patriotism in a way you might not always think about: scientific research. If
you're an American taxpayer, your tax dollars currently go towards the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the world's largest funder of biomedical
research. As a result, the US is the primary driver of science and technology
innovation in the world. Between 2010 and 2019, 354 out of 356 of drugs approved
by the FDA received funding from the NIH during their
[development](https://www.bentley.edu/news/new-study-shows-nih-investment-new-drug-approvals-comparable-investment-pharmaceutical)
-- a whopping 99.4%. These medications included Keytruda, a breakthrough cancer
treatment, Trikafta, a life-changing therapy for many with cystic fibrosis, and
Imbruvica, a breakthrough therapy for blood cancers. As your neighborhood
scientists, we want you to feel proud to be American this July 4th because those
breakthroughs came from your tax dollars -- and as scientists, we're proud to be
entrusted with those dollars to generate tomorrow's medical breakthroughs.

We recently asked some of our neighborhood scientists why they are proud to do
taxpayer-funded scientific research in the US. In their answers, we hope that
you, too, can feel some American pride in science this July 4th. Here are a few:

"As a US scientist, I get to make discoveries about how nature works with
creative, intelligent, hard-working people from all around the world. US
taxpayer-funded research grants and fellowships are pushing science forward from
a knowledge perspective, and also by training the next generation of scientists
and shifting the culture of academia to welcome people from all walks of life,
helping the world to benefit from their unique contributions. I'm proud to make
basic science discoveries that can one day inform medical breakthroughs (like
the scientists who contribute to mRNA vaccines, and treatments for chronic
illnesses and genetic conditions)."

advance our basic knowledge of mammalian biology and have profound potential to
improve human health. I'm proud to do this work in a country that has
consistently been a global leader in biomedical research!"

"I am proud to do research because my colleagues and I are learning more about
the world we all live in and how it works. I believe that this understanding can
help us tackle problems in the world like disease but also I think the knowledge
alone is exciting. I am proud that the research I do is taxpayer-funded because
it means it is not beholden to a corporation but for the good of the public,
even beyond our borders. In a time of "America First" this is a way our country
is still giving to the world."

"Every day, I am reminded of the fact that we do not understand enough about
the diseases and conditions we encounter on a regular basis. For example,
Alzheimer's disease -- almost everyone knows someone or is related to someone
with Alzheimer's disease. We have made remarkable progress in diagnosing this
condition, but we still have few truly effective treatments. Research has the
potential to change this, and I am proud to be among those working to change the
status quo. When people receive the diagnosis for a condition such as
Alzheimer's, it can be devastating, both to them and to their loved ones. Still,
many people are comforted and even reassured by the fact that we are working on
a solution... even if we do not have one today, there is hope for tomorrow. I am
proud to be a source of hope for these people, their families, and their
friends."

forces would say that there are not enough people with severe disabilities to
support this research. But the technology is desperately needed. And so many of
our modern conveniences have grown from research into special-purpose technology
that no one realized would be wildly popular once it became available."

Over the next week, we'll continue to highlight the incredible scientists that
do this government-funded research and the citizens who benefit and support it,
from high school teachers to those obtaining medical treatment through
NIH-funded clinical trials. If you're not already, you can follow us on
[Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/your.neighborhoodscientist),
[Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/neighborhoodscientist),
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/your-neighborhood-scientist), and
[Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/your.neighborhoodscientist.org).
We hope that you'll share with your neighbors why funding science is patriotic,
and we hope you feel proud, too. Because those scientific breakthroughs? They're
made in the USA -- thanks to you.

## July 5th, 2025

Science and research innovations are everywhere -- if you just know where to
look! Almost everything you see in the natural environment, we know more about
because of scientific research. Why do the leaves fall from the trees in the
fall? Why do birds fly south? What makes the tides go in and out every day?

This knowledge is important because it helps us plan for things like hurricanes
and figure out how to set up home foundations so they don't sink into the
ground. It also helps us develop innovations that help us preserve the natural
world -- like window stickers to avoid migrating bird collisions.

Today, we're highlighting scientists who love the taxpayer-funded work they do
because it helps them understand the world around us. How has science helped you
understand the world around you?

ones who are pushing the boundaries of what we know to cure diseases and solve
today's medical mysteries so that we can have more tomorrows.

Do you or a loved one benefit from medical advances that originated from
NIH-funded research (if you've ever taken a medication or been to a hospital,
that answer is yes!) Feel free to share your stories below, and why you're proud
to fund this work with your tax dollars!

When you think of creativity, you probably think of artists and writers. But
what about scientists? For many, scientific research provides an opportunity to
ask creative questions and generate new ways to answer them. In doing so,
scientists are able to tackle today's problems from unique angles and provide
solutions that haven't been used before. Ultimately, this can generate novel
disease cures and treatment options for people that didn't previously exist.

Today, we're highlighting scientists who love the creative freedom offered by
basic science research funded by the National Institutes of Health and National
Science Foundation -- the two largest funders of science research. We are inspired
by their commitment to finding creative solutions to tough problems, and we hope
you are, too.

The two largest funders of research in the U.S. -- the National Institutes of
Health and the National Science Foundation -- are funded by taxpayer dollars. This
research is behind every medical breakthrough we see today, from the drugs on
the market to new imaging methods to detect cancers to robotics that make
surgery less invasive.

That also means that these breakthroughs are all because of *you*. If you pay
taxes in the U.S., every cancer cure and Alzheimer's drug and addiction
treatment option is all thanks to you and the funding from your tax dollars for
the NIH and NSF. And here at Your Neighborhood Scientist, we think that's
something to be proud of.

## July 9th, 2025

We asked scientists across the U.S. why they're proud to do science here, and
their answers ranged from curing diseases to giving back to understanding the
world around us. Many also mentioned that they love to do science here because
it's *hard*. U.S. science is held to an extremely high standard of
excellence -- grant funding is competitive, publishing requires multiple reviews
from peers, and studies have to be designed rigorously. That high standard
drives scientists to do excellent work with the critical eye that is needed to
develop cures for today's most complex diseases, from cancer and autoimmune
disorders to genetic conditions and dementia.

If you or a loved one has ever received a challenging medical diagnosis, you
know that navigating a diagnosis like cancer or a genetic condition can be
daunting. When we asked U.S. scientists why they love the science they do, many
shared that their work is able to be a source of hope for those who have been
diagnosed with challenging medical conditions. Each day, new treatment options
become available that turn previously devastating diagnoses into a hiccup in
life. Scientists love the work they do because they can provide hope -- because
they know that their work can increase the quality of life and can even save the
lives of those impacted by the diseases they study.

That's a wrap for our feature celebrating American science! We hope that you,
too, can feel some pride that your taxpayer dollars support such amazing
scientists and their impactful work.
