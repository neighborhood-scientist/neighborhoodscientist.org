Here at Your Neighborhood Scientist, we're excited to highlight American
patriotism in a way you might not always think about: scientific research. If
you're an American taxpayer, your tax dollars currently go towards the National
Institutes of Health (NIH), which is the world's largest funder of biomedical
research. As a result, the US is the primary driver of science and technology
innovation in the world. Between 2010 and 2019, 354 out of 356 of drugs approved
by the FDA received funding from the NIH during their
[development](https://www.bentley.edu/news/new-study-shows-nih-investment-new-drug-approvals-comparable-investment-pharmaceutical)
-- a whopping 99.4%. These medications included Keytruda, a breakthrough cancer
treatment, Trikafta, a life-changing therapy for many with cystic fibrosis, and
Imbruvica, a breakthrough therapy for blood cancers. As your neighborhood
scientists, we want you to feel proud to be American this July 4th because those
breakthroughs came from your tax dollars -- and as scientists, we're proud to be
entrusted with those dollars to generate tomorrow's medical breakthroughs.

We recently asked some of our neighborhood scientists why they are proud to do
taxpayer-funded scientific research in the US. In their answers, we hope that
you, too, can feel some American pride in science this July 4th. Here are a few:

"As a US scientist, I get to make discoveries about how nature works with
creative, intelligent, hard-working people from all around the world. US
taxpayer-funded research grants and fellowships are pushing science forward from
a knowledge perspective, and also by training the next generation of scientists
and shifting the culture of academia to welcome people from all walks of life,
helping the world to benefit from their unique contributions. I'm proud to make
basic science discoveries that can one day inform medical breakthroughs (like
the scientists who contribute to mRNA vaccines, and treatments for chronic
illnesses and genetic conditions)."

"My work helps understand relapse and why stress causes us to seek out certain
rewards (substances, comfort food, bingeing tv) â€” my work informs clinicians,
counselors, and therapists to help people struggling with addiction."

I work on developing vaccines and looking into immunity in general against
influenza virus. I'm proud to perform taxpayer-funded research in the US because
I know my work could eventually lead to life-saving vaccines. I want to protect
people from infectious diseases and vaccines are one of the best ways to do
that."

Performing research is my most cherished expression of creativity! It brings
me so much joy to develop new ideas, tools, and technologies that fundamentally
advance our basic knowledge of mammalian biology and have profound potential to
improve human health. I'm proud to do this work in a country that has
consistently been a global leader in biomedical research!"

:::{.callout-tip style="" title="For the good of the public" icon=false}
I am proud to do research because my colleagues and I are learning more about
the world we all live in and how it works. I believe that this understanding can
help us tackle problems in the world like disease but also I think the knowledge
alone is exciting. I am proud that the research I do is taxpayer-funded because
it means it is not beholden to a corporation but for the good of the public,
even beyond our borders. In a time of "America First" this is a way our country
is still giving to the world."

:::{.callout-warning style="" title="I am proud to be a source of hope" icon=false}
Every day, I am reminded of the fact that we do not understand enough about
the diseases and conditions we encounter on a regular basis. For example,
Alzheimer's disease - almost everyone knows someone or is related to someone
with Alzheimer's disease. We have made remarkable progress in diagnosing this
condition, but we still have few truly effective treatments. Research has the
potential to change this, and I am proud to be among those working to change the
status quo. When people receive the diagnosis for a condition such as
Alzheimer's, it can be devastating, both to them and to their loved ones. Still,
many people are comforted and even reassured by the fact that we are working on
a solution... even if we do not have one today, there is hope for tomorrow. I am
proud to be a source of hope for these people, their families, and their
friends."

I do research on technology for people with disabilities. Market-driven
forces would say that there are not enough people with severe disabilities to
support this research. But the technology is desperately needed. And so many of
our modern conveniences have grown from research into special-purpose technology
that no one realized would be wildly popular once it became available."

I study the activity of immune cells in antiphospholipid syndrome, an
autoimmune disease that can cause dangerous blood clots to form.
Antiphospholipid syndrome is poorly understood, and many patients experience
strokes, cardiovascular issues, and other life-threatening complications of
disease. I'm proud to contribute to our knowledge of antiphospholipid syndrome
and other immune-mediated diseases, to allow for the development of new
medications and therapies to better treat patients around the world."

Over the next week, we'll continue to highlight the incredible scientists that
do this government-funded research and the citizens who benefit and support it,
from high school teachers to those obtaining medical treatment through
NIH-funded clinical trials. If you're not already, you can follow us on

We hope that you'll share with your neighbors why funding science is patriotic,
and we hope you feel proud, too. Because those scientific breakthroughs? They're
made in the USA -- thanks to you.
