    "section": "",
    "text": "On May 25, 2023, I held my mom’s hand while she signed consent forms to enroll as the 94th patient in a clinical trial at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). We were sitting in the NIH Clinical Center, the world’s largest hospital dedicated to clinical research. Some call it the “House of Hope.” We do too.\nA decade before the ink dried on those consent forms, I began my first post-college job within sight of the “House of Hope.” I was hired in a full-time research position through the NIH Intramural Postbaccalaureate Program. This is a training opportunity for recent college graduates considering graduate or professional school in healthcare and STEM fields. I worked in Building 50, the Louis Stokes Laboratories, which houses the laboratories of the National Human Genome Research Institute, one of 27 Institutes and Centers of the NIH. These Institutes compose the NIH Intramural Program, which is supported by 11% of the NIH budget and funds the nearly 6,000 scientists on the NIH main campus in Bethesda, Maryland, and other smaller NIH campuses across the US.\nI spent two exciting and impactful years working in the laboratory of Dr. Francis Collins, the NIH Director at the time. With my mentors, I studied how genetic variation can lead to Type 2 Diabetes. This experience laid the groundwork for my career as a geneticist, and, unbeknownst to me at the time, it prepared me for my role as a caregiver of an NIH patient. I knew how to search ClinicalTrials.gov for treatment opportunities. I trusted her team of providers. My familiarity with the NIH and biomedical research enabled me to advocate for and support my mom during this journey.\nThe world’s experts on my mom’s rare disease, lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG), work at the National Cancer Institute of the NIH. In the summer of 2023, they gave my mom life-saving, but grueling, chemotherapy, to rid her body of the rapidly multiplying cells caused by Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). This is the virus that causes mono and lives dormant in about 90% of us. In my mom, Epstein Barr Virus is active and causing problems. Because it is a rare disease, it has taken over 30 years to enroll enough patients to really understand the way this disease works and how to treat it.\n\n\n\nBrooke and her mom after she completed her last of 6 rounds of chemotherapy at the NIH Clinical Center.\n\n\n\nBefore this clinical trial, scientific publications established the median survival for LYG as 14 months, because it wasn’t clear how to treat these patients. When she was diagnosed, this trial felt like our only hope. Her private insurance was unlikely to cover medicine not yet demonstrated to be the standard of care for LYG. Determining standard of care for a rare disease is time consuming and expensive! This is the kind of life-changing work the NIH Intramural Program supports. Led by Dr. Christopher Melani, the clinical trial successfully established a set of treatments as standard of care, publishing a median survival of 12.1 years1. This result will facilitate better treatment of LYG at hospitals across the country and globally.\nClinical trials like the one that saved my mom fall under the NIH’s Intramural Research program. Thanks to taxpayer dollars, my mom’s treatment was paid for. So was the fuel she used to drive the 7 hours to and from rural North Carolina. Budget cuts have reduced the amount she is reimbursed for her accommodations in Maryland, but this is the price we will pay for more years together. For NIH patients facing hardships, the Friends of Patients at the NIH is a charitable organization that helps with emotional, financial, and logistical support.\nFast forward to January 2025, and my mom was one treatment into her second clinical trial at the NIH. After a year in remission, her disease was back, so the doctors were trying something new. As the new Presidential administration came to Washington, Executive Orders caused communication and travel bans, as well as funding freezes at the NIH. We were incredibly concerned how new policy might affect her ability to continue treatment. As of now, her trial is running as expected. However, the NIH Intramural Postbaccalaureate Program which once employed me, and provides valuable training to the next generation of our nation’s scientists and physicians, is paused pending guidance from the Department of Health and Human Services.\nAs a scientist and a daughter of a rare disease warrior, the NIH Intramural Research Program has changed my life. It is my deepest wish that the NIH continues to be a model of excellence for biomedical research by treating patients, training scientists, making discoveries, stimulating the economy, and providing hope for decades to come. I hope the “House of Hope” will be there for you, too, if you one day need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nBrooke is a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellow at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

    "text": "Hello!\nMy name is Audrey, and I’m a neuroscientist. I study brain cells: how they talk to each other, what they’re saying, and how they help us figure out what’s going on in our environments.\nI started this newsletter because I’m increasingly concerned about how science and medical research is viewed by the public. There’s been a shift over the last few years in how I hear people talk about science, and it’s at odds with what I see and experience in my day-to-day life as a researcher. I feel so excited about the amount of progress being made in the scientific community, from treatments for HIV and pediatric cancers to new vaccines for RSV and cancer, but I sense a growing unease with these same discoveries amongst the general public, with an increase in discussion of conspiracy theories (like the myth that vaccines cause autism), a decrease in the number of people who support public health measures backed by science (like fluoride in our drinking water), and general growing distrust in the scientific and medical communities.\nI’m sure there are many factors at play that have widened this chasm between scientists and non-scientists, but I think one is a misunderstanding of how science works: how basic science informs medical breakthroughs, how science is funded in the US, and the role that pharmaceutical companies and medical professionals play. I think most people would be surprised to hear that much of what we know about human genetics comes from studying yeast and worms, or that the US federal government funds upwards of 90% of the research happening at universities across the US, both public and private.\nIn addition, I think another big driver of this gap between scientists and the general public is a misunderstanding of who scientists are. I’ve worked in academia for the last nine years of my life, and the people I work with are some of the most compassionate, hard-working, dedicated individuals, who sacrifice many years of their lives to bring new advancements into the world that will make our lives better. As I read Facebook comments and see the rhetoric on TV, I often find myself wishing I could just show people the scientists I know: I wish I could bring you to lab and show you the people I work with every day, show you how hard they are working, and show you how the work they do makes your life better and our communities stronger.\nYour Neighborhood Scientist is my initiative to do just that: to tell the world how the scientists in your neighborhoods are working hard—just like you—to leave a positive mark on this world. I started this newsletter because I believe that we can work together to show the world that science is critical to the health and well-being of our communities. Changing this rhetoric is no small task, and I think it starts with information: how does this all work? How does the work scientists do every day, funded by taxpayers, eventually end up handed to you over the counter at your local pharmacy in a paper bag that contains life-saving medication? How does it strengthen our economy? How does it enhance our national defense and emergency preparedness?\nI also realize that if you’re reading this newsletter, you’re likely someone who is somewhat interested in science. I probably don’t have to convince you too much that we should fund basic science research, and that scientists are incredible, genuine people who are trying to make the world a better place. But why do you think that? Maybe it’s because you understand the intricacies of science, and you know about NIH institutes and CAR-T cell pathways. Or maybe not: most likely, you believe in science because you know and trust me, Audrey, your neighborhood scientist. People’s beliefs are not informed by facts and information: they are informed by feelings and trust.\nIn our newsletter, we’ll work to fill the science information gap by stressing the importance of basic science research and providing information about how it works, and I hope that you do learn more about the work scientists do. But to me, it’s not important if you remember specific details, like what an indirect rate is at the NIH. What’s important is that you feel inspired to tell other people that know and trust you about how important you think science is. Perhaps over time they might even become convinced that they, too, should advocate for scientists and good science policy. The goal is to provide the knowledge that scientists are working hard to make the world a better place and use this as a vehicle to spread positive feelings and trust surrounding science, because these are the things that change people’s minds.\nI don’t know what will ultimately happen with this journey, but if you read all the way through: thank you. Tell someone who trusts you about science today, and see you in a couple weeks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\nDr. Audrey Drotos is a Neuroscientist at the University of Pennsylvania where she studies how we hear. She is a founder of Your Neighborhood Scientist. Outside of science and writing, she enjoys long-distance trail running, thrifting vintage jackets, buying really good apples at the farmer’s market, and curling up with a great book, preferably one by Ed Yong."
