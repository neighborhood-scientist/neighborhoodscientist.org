Your Neighborhood Scientist is an initiative to cultivate community-based
conversations about science, science policy, and scientists.

Currently, there is an information gap between public perception of science and
the reality of the good that science does in our communities. To help fill this
gap, we publish a newsletter written by scientists and community leaders about
exciting, taxpayer-funded research that's happening in the US and the positive
impact that science and science policy has on the world around us. We also talk
about the diversity of people who do science, and the many ways that science
helps our communities, often behind the scenes. Our articles are written and
edited by the scientists doing the work, so you know that you're getting
information about what's really happening â€” not just clickbait.

Our hope is that our readers will help us shift the current national narrative
by talking to their neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends about why science
is important in their communities and why we need science policy that supports
scientists doing the work they do best.

With your help, we can show the world that science benefits everyone and that
our communities are better off for it.
