**Scientist on the block** articles are written by scientists about why they love
the science that they do. The goal is to communicate joy about the work that
scientists do and humanize the many types of people who do science. Here are a
few prompts to get started, but also feel free to think outside the box:

- What first got you interested in your line of work? Was it a science fair in middle school? Nature walks as a kid?
- What excites you most about the research you do?
- What kinds of challenges have you overcome to get to where you are today?
- What makes you feel proud about your research? What kinds of positive impacts can it have on society?
- What are you excited about for your future in science?

We want people to feel excited about the research you do because you are excited
about the research that you do and its impact. We want them to feel proud to be
taxpayers that fund such amazing humans doing science, and we want them to be
rooting for you and your success. It's a tall order, but we think that your joy
about science will be contagious.
